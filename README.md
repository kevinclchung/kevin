# Kevin Chung's Resume

This repository is a Vite + Vue project and contains code for www.kevinclchung.com and kevinclchung.github.io/resume.

It is currently under construction.

### Why Vue, and not React or Angular?

I've had experience with a number of FE frameworks and libraries: JQuery, Backbone, AngularJS, Angular, React, and Vue. Each one of these frameworks have their strangths and weaknesses. But for this project, I needed to use a framework that was rapid, and easily maintainable.

### Why pure SFCs? Why not separate concerns with different file types?

When components get a little complex, I do prefer to adhere to true separation of concerns and split them into different .vue, .ts, and .scss files. However, these components are pretty atomized and simple enough to keep in one file.

However, the galaga component is pretty complex, and that is why I wrote those in separate files.
